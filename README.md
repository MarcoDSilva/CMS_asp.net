# Learning_aspNet

ProjW, an exercise where we applied MVC methods with .NET and the Entity Framework to take care of the database.

In this I learned how to use Views(Razor and viewbags), Models and Controllers, as well as ViewModels.

Mostly is a program that has jobs being done by employees to solve the clients problems. Each has a priority type, a type of job and a description of said job.
